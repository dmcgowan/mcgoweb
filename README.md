McGoWeb
=======

McGoWeb is a microframework intended to be easy to embed inside of 
a Go application.  As distributed systems have become the norm and 
continue to grow, so does the need for management tools and clean 
APIs.  McGoWeb intends to make it easy to add RESTful APIs and 
embedded web management to Go applications.  The current target use 
case is not for standalone web applications, however McGoWeb is 
extensible and can be developed to fit that use case.
